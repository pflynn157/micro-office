# Micro Desktop

This is a small collection of desktop applications written in C++ using the Qt framework. The following applications are included:

* Editor -> A text/code editor designed in the spirit of the old Gedit
* File Explorer -> A small system file explorer
* Media Player -> An audio/video player
* Spreadsheets -> A simple spreadsheet application

This project is a merge of four existing projects I've had for many years. The purpose of merging them together was to unify the build system, keep them all up to date at once, and upgrade the APIs to Qt6. I also removed all external dependencies and kept any that I needed within the project.

All the code I wrote is in the public domain. Any included dependencies are subject to their own licenses.
